= yonn

*yonn* is a modern c++ implementation of deep learning framework.

== Supported networks

=== layer-types

- average pooling layer
- convolutional layer
- fully connected layer

=== activation functions

- tanh
- leaky relu

=== loss functions

- mean squared error
- mean absolute error
- softmax

=== optimization algorithms

- adagrad
- rmsprop
- adam
- adamax
- stochastic gradient descent
- momentum and nesterov momentum

== Progress

- stage i completed, works great on CPU

=== Design revision

- is it needful to make every layer's op inheirts from `op_kernel`
- rule of five (zero), virtual destructor
- `REPEAT` preprocessor util
